**Hone your software design skills by implementing popular design patterns in Java**

## What is this book about?
As the experience level increases for software developers, it becomes crucial to develop the required skillset for developing quality code. This book will enable you to identify and apply common design patterns for building quality applications by refining your code.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the most common problems that can be solved using Java design patterns
* Uncover Java building elements, their usages, and concurrency possibilities
* Optimize a vehicle memory footprint with the Flyweight Pattern
* Explore one-to-many relations between instances with the observer pattern
* Discover how to route vehicle messages by using the visitor pattern
* Utilize and control vehicle resources with the thread-pool pattern
* Understand the penalties caused by anti-patterns in software design

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
public class Vehicle {
 private boolean moving;
   public void move(){
       this.moving = true;
       System.out.println("moving...");
 }
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are an intermediate-level Java developer or software architect looking to learn the practical implementation of software design patterns in Java, then this book is for you. No prior knowledge of design patterns is required, but an understanding of Java programming is necessary.
